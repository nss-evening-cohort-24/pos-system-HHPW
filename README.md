## Hip Hop, Pizza, n’ Wangs POS System

#### NSS E24 Group Project by panicRoom

For this group project, our team was contacted by a mom and pop restaurant, Hip Hop, Pizza, n’ Wangs, to help streamline their order processing system. As their business has grown, they were in need of a new point of sale system to keep up with their demand. 

Features of this application include:
Google User Authentication 
Homepage with the user’s name displayed and buttons that allow you to view all orders, create an order, and view revenue
Create an order for a customer that includes their information and order type (phone or in-person)

View, Edit or Delete an order
Under view Order Details, you are able to add or delete a menu item from the order
From the view order details page, you are able to close an order by processing the Close Payment form
The option to filter to between all orders, open orders, and closed orders
Ability to search through all orders
User can also view all up to date revenue
