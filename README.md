## Hip Hop, Pizza, n’ Wangs POS System

## NSS E24 Group Project by panicRoom

For this group project, our team was contacted by a mom and pop restaurant, Hip Hop, Pizza, n’ Wangs, to help streamline their order processing system.
As their business has grown, they were in need of a new point of sale system to keep up with their demand.
